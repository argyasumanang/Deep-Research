        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Together's Open Deep Research Cookbook! This guide demonstrates how to answer complex research questions with comprehensive, evidence-based reports by combining the power of large language models (LLMs) with structured web search techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "We break down the research process into clear, modular steps that can be understood, customized, and improved independently. This modularity makes advanced research capabilities accessible and adaptable to diverse research needs.\n",

        "Our Deep Research framework offers several key advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Progressive Exploration**: Starting with initial queries derived from your research topic, the system intelligently explores information, identifies gaps, and refines its search strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Evidence-Based Synthesis**: All findings are grounded in verified sources with proper citations, reducing the hallucinations common in pure LLM-based question and answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adaptive Search with Completeness Evaluation**: The system evaluates information gaps against research goals and generates targeted follow-up queries for missing specifics. This ensures resources focus precisely on completing your research rather than collecting redundant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Source Filtering**: Not all information is equally valuable - our system evaluates and prioritizes the most relevant and reliable sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Structured Output**: Results are presented as well-organized reports with clear sections, cohesive narratives, and proper citations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Cookbook Contributions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Set up a flexible research environment with configurable parameters\n",
        "- Process complex topics through a multi-stage research pipeline\n",
        "- Generate high-quality reports for the given research topic\n",
        "\n",
        "The functional design pattern we showcase makes each step transparent and customizable, allowing you to adapt the system to specific domains or research styles. Each function handles a specific part of the research process, from query generation to answer synthesis, with explicit inputs and outputs that can be tested and improved independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether you're a researcher, student, analyst, or curious explorer, this cookbook provides the tools to transform your research questions into comprehensive, evidence-based reports that would normally require hours of manual work.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's begin our exploration of AI-powered research!"

        "\n",
        "While the Deep Search approach offers powerful research capabilities, it's important to understand its limitations and constraints:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Information Constraints\n",
        "- **Recency Gap**: Search-based research is limited by the indexing latency of search engines. Very recent events or publications may not be captured.\n",
        "- **Access Limitations**: Some valuable information sources may be behind paywalls or otherwise inaccessible to the search system.\n",
        "- **Domain Specificity**: Highly specialized or technical domains may have limited indexing in general search engines.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Processing Considerations\n",
        "- **Query Dependency**: The quality of results is heavily influenced by the initial and follow-up queries generated. Poorly formulated queries can lead to information gaps.\n",
        "- **Source Reliability**: While the system attempts to prioritize credible sources, it cannot perfectly assess the accuracy or bias of all content.\n",
        "- **Content Extraction Challenges**: Complex formats like tables, charts, or specialized notation may not be accurately captured in the content processing stage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resource Requirements\n",
        "- **API Costs**: The system makes multiple calls to search and LLM APIs, which can incur significant costs for extensive research topics.\n",
        "- **Time Efficiency**: The iterative, multi-step nature of the process means it takes longer than simple RAG or direct LLM approaches.\n",
        "- **Model Dependencies**: The quality of outputs depends on having access to capable LLM models for different stages of the pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Ethical Considerations\n",
        "- **Source Attribution**: While the system attempts to provide proper citations, it may not always perfectly attribute information to original creators.\n",
        "- **Content Bias**: The system may inadvertently amplify biases present in the indexed content or search ranking algorithms.\n",
        "- **Privacy Implications**: Research on certain topics may involve information with privacy sensitivities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding these limitations helps set appropriate expectations and identify situations where this approach should be complemented with other research methodologies. For critical research needs, human review and validation remain essential."
